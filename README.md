## Motivation

[DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) doesn¬¥t provide an automatic way to delete old snapshots.


## Install

This recommended way is to download the latest binary for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/brpaz/do-snapshot-pruner/releases) page.

You can also use our [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brpaz/do-snapshot-pruner).


## Usage

```sh
do-snapshot-pruner -n <days> -t <do_token>
```

Where:

* "n" -> The number of days before current date to delete. For Exemple if you see this value with "3", the tool will delete all the snaphots older than 3 days.
* "t" -> The DigitalOcean API token. You can get yours [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens). Optionally you can also set the "DO_TOKEN" envrionment variable.

Or with docker:

```sh
docker run -it brpaz/do-snapshot-pruner:latest -t <do_token> -n 5
```

## Run tests

```sh
make test
```
